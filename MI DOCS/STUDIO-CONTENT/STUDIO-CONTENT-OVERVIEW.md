# Studio Content System Overview

## Purpose
Studio Content transforms Villa Capriani's real-world property and owner data into a comprehensive content management system that serves as both production CRM functionality and test content for Studio block development.

## Core Components

### 1. Villa Data System

- **Owners**: 154 unique property owners with full profiles
- **Properties**: 116 units with detailed specifications
- **Committees**: Board and committee member information
- **Relationships**: Many-to-many owner-property associations

### 2. Data Structure

#### JSON-Based Storage
```
