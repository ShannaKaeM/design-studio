# Villa Owners Data Analysis

## Couples & Name Patterns Identified:

### **Likely Couples (Same Last Name, Same Unit):**
1. **Meghan & William Pennington** - Unit 210B (Meghan has email)
2. **Augie Rowland** - Two entries with different emails (likely spouse)
3. **Susanna Tyler** - Two entries with different emails (likely spouse)
4. **Paul & Shanna Middleton** - Units 301A & 209A (both have emails)

### **Business Entities to Flag:**
1. **Surflin LLC** - surflineproperties@charter.net (needs real person contact)

### **Email Matching Analysis:**
- **jbbreene@gmail.com** → Thomas Breene (J.B. = initials)
- **jirwin6@aol.com** → William Irwin (J = first initial)
- **ricklowe14@yahoo.com** → James Lowe (Rick = nickname for Richard, but name is James - needs review)
- **Jacki.marino@gmail.com** → David Marino (Jacki likely spouse)
- **kellyqwhite@gmail.com** → Clayton White (Kelly likely spouse)

### **Missing Individual Profiles Needed:**
- William Pennington (only Meghan has email)
- Augie Rowland's spouse (bellamiadesigns22@gmail.com)
- Susanna Tyler's spouse (Tylers@gmail.com)
- Jacki Marino (email suggests she's the primary contact)
- Kelly White (email suggests she's the primary contact)

### **Data Quality Issues:**
- 16 members without unit assignments
- Several members with only mobile or only home phones
- Some emails clearly belong to spouses not listed

## Recommendations:
1. Create separate profiles for identified couples
2. Match emails to correct individuals
3. Flag business entities for real person contact
4. Create "missing data" flags for incomplete profiles
