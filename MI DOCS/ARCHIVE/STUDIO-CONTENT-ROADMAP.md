### What Needs to Be Done Next
1. **Test Site Functionality** (Current Priority)

   - Test Villa Management sections
   - Confirm Studio blocks are loading

2. **Complete Data Cleanup** (After testing)
   - Run `create-placeholder-owners.php` script to create 29 placeholder owners
   - Verify all owner references are resolved
   - Test admin interfaces thoroughly

3. **Files to Delete** (After full verification)
   - `/villa-data/individual-owners.json` - Legacy consolidated owner file
   - `/villa-data/master-index.json` - Old index file  
   - `/villa-data/migration/` directory - Contains migration scripts
   - `/villa-owner-crm.php` - Legacy CRM class (no longer included)
   - `/villa-individual-owners.php` - Legacy owners class (no longer included)
   - `/villa-individual-registration.php` - Registration system (not needed)

### Current Data State
- 116 properties with consolidated JSON files
