# Studio Theme Integration Roadmap

## Project Overview
Studio is a custom WordPress block system integrated directly into the theme (not a plugin). It provides semantic, AI-ready blocks with a sophisticated design token system.

## Core Principles
- **Theme-First Architecture**: All functionality lives in the theme
- **WordPress Native**: Uses core APIs and standards
- **AI-Ready**: Designed for future content generation
- **Semantic HTML**: Presets ensure proper structure
- **Performance Focused**: Minimal runtime overhead

## Current Status (June 16, 2024)

## Phase 1: Foundation 
### Completed:
- [x] Theme integration architecture
- [x] Studio_Theme_Integration class in functions.php
- [x] Admin menu system

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
/blocksy-child/
├── functions.php          # Studio_Theme_Integration class
├── theme.json            # WordPress theme config
├── /blocks/
│   ├── /studio-text/     
│   ├── /studio-container/ 
│   ├── /studio-button/   
│   ├── /studio-grid/     
│   └── /studio-image/    
└── /assets/
    ├── /css/studio-admin.css
    └── /js/studio-admin.js
```

### Build Process
Each block follows the same structure:
- `block.json` - Block metadata
- `index.js` - React component
- `style.css` - Frontend styles
- `editor.css` - Editor styles
- `/build/` - Compiled assets

1. [ ] Complete manual preset testing for all blocks
2. [ ] Fix any control issues discovered during testing
3. [ ] Document preset creation workflow

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. [ ] Build comprehensive preset library
2. [ ] Enhance block inspector with save preset options
3. [ ] Refine block controls based on testing feedback

### Long Term (Next Month)

1. **Manual Testing First** - Create presets by hand to understand workflow
2. **Iterative Refinement** - Fix controls and issues as discovered
3. **Documentation** - Document learnings for future automation
4. **Build Foundation** - Establish solid preset library before patterns
5. **Progressive Enhancement** - Add features based on real usage patterns
