# Studio Theme Integration Roadmap

## Project Overview
Studio is a custom WordPress block system integrated directly into the theme (not a plugin). It provides semantic, AI-ready blocks with a sophisticated design token system.

## Core Principles
- **Theme-First Architecture**: All functionality lives in the theme
- **WordPress Native**: Uses core APIs and standards
- **AI-Ready**: Designed for future content generation
- **Semantic HTML**: Presets ensure proper structure
- **Performance Focused**: Minimal runtime overhead

## Technical Implementation

### File Structure
```
/blocksy-child/
├── functions.php          # Studio_Theme_Integration class
├── theme.json            # WordPress theme config
├── studio.json           # Studio token definitions
├── /blocks/
│   ├── /studio-text/     
│   ├── /studio-container/ 
│   ├── /studio-button/   
│   ├── /studio-grid/     
│   └── /studio-image/    
└── /assets/
    ├── /css/studio-admin.css
    └── /js/studio-admin.js
```

### Build Process
Each block follows the same structure:
- `block.json` - Block metadata
- `index.js` - React component
- `style.css` - Frontend styles
- `editor.css` - Editor styles
- `/build/` - Compiled assets

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
1. [ ] Fix Block Style Builder bugs
2. [ ] Create first set of patterns
3. [ ] Update all documentation

### Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)
1. [ ] Complete pattern library
2. [ ] Add more block variations
3. [ ] Enhance responsive controls
4. [ ] Add animation options

### Long Term (Next Month)
1. [ ] AI integration planning
2. [ ] Advanced layout blocks
3. [ ] Global styles integration
4. [ ] Performance optimization

## Success Metrics
