# ðŸŽ¯ Studio Overview & Current Status

Last Updated: June 16, 2024

## **What Studio Is:**

Studio is a WordPress theme-integrated system for AI-powered block creation with centralized design token management. It enables AI to create professionally designed WordPress sites by hydrating blocks with JSON content and design decisions using semantic presets.

### Core Components:
1. **Design Token System** - Direct theme.json integration (no intermediate files)
2. **Custom Studio Blocks** - WordPress-native blocks with semantic presets
3. **Admin Interface** - Tabbed token editor with direct save functionality
4. **AI Integration** - Future JSON hydration for content and design

## **Current Status (June 16, 2024)**

### âœ… Completed

## **Architecture Decisions:**

### 1. **Theme-First Approach**
All Studio functionality is integrated directly into the theme rather than requiring a separate plugin. This provides:
- Cleaner architecture
- Better performance
- Easier deployment
- No plugin dependencies

### 2. **WordPress Standards**
- Uses theme.json as single source of truth
- Follows block.json specification
- Leverages WordPress preset APIs
- Native block editor integration

### 3. **Token Flow**
```
Studio Admin UI â†’ theme.json â†’ WordPress Blocks
```

### 4. **Security**
- All AJAX endpoints use nonce verification
- Proper capability checks (manage_options, edit_posts)
- Input sanitization and output escaping

## **Key Differentiators:**

### vs GenerateBlocks:
- **Semantic Presets**: Focus on meaning (title, subtitle) not just appearance
- **AI-Ready**: Designed for JSON hydration and AI content generation
- **Token-First**: Centralized design system management
- **Theme Integration**: No plugin dependency for production

### vs Block Themes:
- **Visual Management**: GUI for all token and preset editing
- **Semantic Layer**: Presets carry meaning, not just styles
- **AI Integration**: Built for automated content creation
- **Flexible Architecture**: Works with any theme

## **Next Steps:**

1. **Create Pattern Library** - Build reusable patterns with Studio blocks
2. **Fix Block Style Builder** - Complete the visual style creation interface
3. **Document Everything** - Update all docs to match implementation
4. **AI Integration** - Implement JSON hydration system
