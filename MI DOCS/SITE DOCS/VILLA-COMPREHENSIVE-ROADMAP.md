## **üè† Properties JSON Architecture Plan**

### **Core Concept: Properties as Single Source of Truth**
Each property serves dual purposes:
1. **Front-End Marketing Tool** - Rental/sale listings with rich media and amenities
2. **Back-End Management Hub** - Complete property history, maintenance, financials

**Key Principle**: Owners come and go, but property records persist with complete history.
