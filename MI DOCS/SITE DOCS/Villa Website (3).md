# **Owner First Governance**

Welcome to **Owner First Governance** at Villa Capriani—a modern, inclusive, and collaborative approach to community management designed specifically to give owners a voice in decision-making.

This structure ensures all initiatives align with our collective interests and long-term goals.

Our committees are central to this new governance model, ensuring the Villa is maintained, enhanced, and consistently aligned with our mission of providing a premier coastal experience. Owners are encouraged to join committees to directly impact our community’s future.
